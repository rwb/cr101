#### Textbook

Steven P Lab, Marian R. Williams, Jefferson E. Holcomb, Melissa W. Burek, William R. King, and Michael E. Buerger (2018). *Criminal Justice: The Essentials* (5th Edition). New York: Oxford University Press.

#### Disability Accommodations

If you have or think you might have a disability, injury, or other condition that could affect your class performance, please contact the [Student Disability Resource Center](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/). I will abide by accommodations recommended by the Disability Resource Center in this course.

#### Academic Integrity Statement

You are expected to practice the highest standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment, and may result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, presenting someone else's work as your own, and any other form of academic misrepresentation. Please take a few moments to familarize yourself with the University's expectations for student academic integrity which can be found [here](http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf625.pdf).

#### Class Format

We have about 14 weeks of class time this semester. With an in-person class, we normally meet 150 minutes per week. I plan to approximate this same level of lecture time (using video recordings) in this asynchronous online course. All course content will be posted on this webpage. You are responsible for developing and maintaining a regular schedule of: (1) monitoring the course webpage for both content and course-related announcements; (2) doing your assigned reading; (3) reviewing the posted content; and (4) completing your assignments in a timely fashion. Please feel free to email me with any questions (either content or logistics).

#### Class Grades

Your grade in this class will be based on your performance on assignments distributed throughout the semester. Each assignment will include a set of 7 short-answer questions that must be completed within a 35-minute time window (the 35 minute clock will begin to tick once you start the assignment). You can answer each of the questions in no more than 2 or 3 sentences and you are free to use your book and your notes during each assignment but you are required to work independently -- with no assistance from any other person. The questions will be based on reading and lecture material we have covered since the last assignment. Each question will be worth one point toward your final grade at the end of the semester. Letter grades will be assigned as follows: A = 90 or more points; B+ = 85-89 points; B = 80-84 points; C+ = 75-79 points; C = 70-74 points; D+ = 65-69 points; D = 60-64 points; F = 59 or fewer points. You can accumulate partial credit for questions when appropriate. Therefore, if you end up with fractional points at the end of the semester, I will round up or down to the nearest round number (i.e., an 89.1 will give you a B+ but an 89.6 will give you an A). You are welcome to discuss grade issues with me during an online office meeting. Please don't send me [emails](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/can-email-ever-be-secure/) about your grades.

#### Late Submissions

Each week, the assignment will be open on Blackboard on Thursday and Friday giving you two full days to complete the work. The work will be due on Friday evening by 11:59pm (ET). If you have an extenuating circumstance that requires you to submit an assignment late, I will hear your concern and consider whether a late submission is appropriate. Examples of extenuating circumstances include your or a family member's illness or an incapacity to complete the work due to circumstances beyond your control. Forgetting about the due date for an assignment is not an extenuating circumstance.  

#### Required Technology

Weekly assignments will be posted on Blackboard and you should complete your assignments and monitor your grades there. It is your responsibility to have a properly functioning computer and web access so you can successfully learn the material in this course.

* Motivation for the MDVE
* Theoretical ideas within the MDVE
* How the MDVE was carried out.
* Treatments used and outcomes measured.
* MDVE results
* Policy impact of the MDVE

### Lesson 5 - Monday 8/24/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/FMtpO5IK_C0).

* Announcement: Lesson 5 is the last lecture for the first assignment. 

* Note: Beginning this week, a 30-35 minute lecture will be posted each day from Saturday-Tuesday. The material in these lectures will be covered on each week's assignment due on Thursday-Friday; *please remember you will have 35 minutes to work on the assignment and you must complete the assignment in one sitting so be sure to pick a time on Thursday or Friday when you can work on the assignment uninterrupted for 35 minutes*. You do not have to watch the lectures on the days they are posted. You do need to review them before you work on the assignment each week. I will do my best to have the Tuesday lecture posted before office hours on Tuesday afternoon.

* Here are a few practice questions to give you an idea of the kinds of questions I will be asking on the assignments.

1. What is a theory? - Example Answer: a description of a process that generates observed data.
2. Describe the age-arrest curve. - Example Answer: the age-arrest curve tells us that arrest rates rise dramatically during early adolescence, peak in late adolescence and early adulthood, and then decline for the rest of the lifespan.
3. Explain what we mean by the term "recidivism." - Example Answer: Recidivism is new offending among people who have offended in the past.
4. Identify the main strength and the main weakness of the science of criminology. - Example Answer: Criminologists are good at describing patterns of criminal behavior but not so good at explaining that behavior.
5. What is federalism? - Example Answer: federalism pertains to the idea that power should be separated among different entities rather than invested in a single person or agency. In the United States, power is distributed between federal, state, and local governments, and most jurisdictions distribute power between legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.

##### Key points from this lecture

### Lesson 10 - Saturday 9/5/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/vfAZVtsPcxc).
* *Note*: Today's lesson is the first lesson for Assignment #3 which will occur on Thursday 9/4 and Friday 9/5.
* We are still examining crime measurement issues on pages 12-14 in the textbook.
* Please make sure you have 35 minutes set aside to do the assignments when you start them. Once you begin an assignment you have to complete it in one sitting.
* Crime counts vs. crime rates
* A rate includes both a numerator (# of crimes) and a denominator (measure of population size)
* A rate also includes a multiplier to scale the fraction (i.e., # of crimes per 100,000 population)
* So, an example calculation is: (# of crimes/# of people) x 100,000
* Homicides/murder are generally the best measured crime.
* In general, we have two distinct ways of measuring homicides/murders in the United States (see below).

```rout
Example 1

* Suppose we have two cities: 
    - (1) a city with 150,000 people; 
    - (2) a city with 200,000 people.
* Now, suppose each city has 150 robberies in a particular month.
* What is the robbery rate for the two cities?
* 150/150,000 x 100,000 = 100 per 100K population
* 150/200,000 x 100,000 = 75 per 100K population.
```

```rout
Example 2

* Suppose we have two cities and both cities 
  have 100,000 population.
* One city has 125,000 people inside the city 
  each day (potential robbery targets)
* The other city has 175,000 people inside the city each day.
* Now, suppose each city has 150 robberies in a particular month.
* Each city will have the same robbery rate in the UCR (150) 
* But, this could be misleading.
* 150/125000 x 100,000 = 120 per 100K population
* 150/175000 x 100,000 = 86 per 100K population.
```

```rout
Example 3

* Burglaries in Greensboro and Charlotte
* Greensboro had 3,766 burglaries in 2009.
* Charlotte had 7,766 burglaries in 2009.
* Population in Greensboro in 2009 was 253,191.
* Population in Charlotte in 2009 was 777,708.
* Burglary rate in Greensboro: (3766/253191) x 100,000 = 1487
* Burglary rate in Charlotte: (7766/777708) x 100,000 = 999

### Lesson 11 - Sunday 9/6/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/IefOY6i_GnA).
* We are continuing today with our discussion of crime measurement (pp. 12-14 in the textbook).
* Today, we focus on the National Crime Victimization Survey.
* Nationally representative household survey.
* Conducted each year since 1973.
* Each fall, a new report is published showing what's occurred in the preceding year.
* I have compiled a series of NCVS results going back to 1973; here is a [link](https://github.com/rwb/ncvs/blob/master/README.md).
* NCVS covers household and personal crimes but not commercial victimizations.
* For personal crimes, the NCVS only examines people who were 12 years old and older.
* NCVS is a voluntary survey; carried out by the U.S. Census Bureau.
* NCVS helps us understand the dark figure of crime (discussed previously). An [example](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf).

### Lesson 12 - Monday 9/7/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/lfb-5P3YsV0).
* Today, we complete our discussion of crime measurement by discussing self-report surveys (completes material on pp. 12-14).
* Self-report surveys examine what people say when they are questioned about their own offending behavior.
* These surveys confirm the large dark figure of crime revealed by crime victimization surveys.
* There are two broad types of surveys: cross-sectional and panel studies.
* A strength is that they give us another window into the characteristics of offenders and the crimes they commit.
* There are three major weaknesses with these surveys: (1) sampling problems; (2) accuracy of reports; and (3) attrition (in panel surveys).
* Here is an [example](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/publications/pediatrics_journal_cumulative_prevalence_of_arrest_from_ages_8-23_in_a_national_sample_2011.pdf) of information we can learn from a self-report survey.
* The idea of the social contract (pp. 14-15).
* Crime control and due process models (p. 15).

### Lesson 13 - Tuesday 9/8/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/rLOSI1QDOY4).
* Announcement: if you choose to come to office hours, please note that I generally only see one student at a time. This means you might be in the "waiting room" for a few minutes while I talk to another student. I will let you in as soon as I can under these circumstances.
* Today's lesson is the last material for Assignment #3 which will be posted from Thursday 9/10 - Friday 9/11.
* Philosophical fluidity (retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation).
* Federalism (separation and dispersion of power).
* Discretion (autonomous decision making).
* Components (four C's) of the criminal justice system.
* Citizens - reporting of crime, interaction with police, serving on juries, mandated reporting, no-drop policies.
* Cops - major predictors of arrest decisions.
* Courts - courtroom work group.
* Corrections - community and institutional.
* Recent developments - victims, social media, and use of force.
* This completes Chapter 1 and the material for Assignment #3.

### Lesson 14 - Saturday 9/12/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/91aRr3ZzmLw).
* Today's lesson is the first material (pp. 25-30) for Chapter 2 and Assignment #4 which will be posted from Thursday 9/17 - Friday 9/18.
* We define the term "law" and consider how laws are made in the United States (p. 26).
* The U.S. Constitution and the idea of constitutional law (p. 26).
* When a law is created, that law applies to a specific jurisdiction (p. 26).
* Key concept: the rule of law (p. 27)
* Customs, traditions, mores, and laws (p. 27)
* Common law and precedent (stare decisis; p. 27)
* Consistency and predictability in the law (echoes of Cesare Beccaria who we discussed previously; p. 27)
* Substantive and procedural laws (p. 30)
* Differences between civil law and criminal law (p. 30).

### Lesson 15 - Sunday 9/13/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/Pr-YvmNGcXo).
* Principle of legality (p. 30)
* Legal requirements for a crime to occur: *actus reus* and *mens rea* (p. 31)
* Acts of omission vs. acts of commission (p. 31)
* Strict liability (p. 32)
* Cause and effect in the criminal law (direct, concurrent, and proximate causes; p. 32)
* Harm requirement (pp. 32-33)
* Harm in the case of crimes like drug use and drug selling (p. 33).
* Crimes against persons -- violent crimes (p. 33).
* Property crimes (p. 34)
* Public order offenses (pp. 34-35)
* Drug offenses (p. 35).
* White-collar offenses (pp. 35-36).

### Lesson 16 - Monday 9/14/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/dnNnQzHbUOA).
* We previously discussed the concept of *actus reus* and how this is a necessary - but generally insufficient - basis for determining that a crime has occurred (p. 36).
* This implies that we can have an action that would often be construed as a crime but still not have an actual crime.
* Justification is the idea that a person's actions - even if they would often be considered criminal - were reasonable under the circumstances (p. 37).
* Sometimes we do not have a crime (even with a serious action) because the person's behavior can be excused (at least in the eyes of the law; p. 37-38).
* Commonly invoked excuses are: (1) insanity; (2) duress; (3) involuntary intoxication; and (4) age (pp. 37-39).
* The textbook treats insanity on its own footing (pp. 38-39) and considers the M'Naghten Rule and the "substantial capacity" test.
* Victims' rights under the law (p. 39).

### Lesson 17 - Tuesday 9/15/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/iE5ySfPBIZ8).
* Today's lesson is the last material covered in Assignment #4 which will be posted on Thursday 9/17 and Friday 9/18.
* We will skip over the section called "Recent Trends in Substantive Criminal Law" (pp. 40-43) but I will put an extra credit question on this week's assignment that covers this material. The extra credit question will be worth one point.
* Overview of procedural legal issues (pp. 43-44).
* Legal rights explicitly mentioned in the main body of the Constitution (p. 44).
* Constitutional amendments and amendment process (pp. 44-45).
* U.S. Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution (and declare laws unconstitutional).
* Supreme Court asserted this power for itself in *Marbury v. Madison* (1803) when it declared the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 unconstitutional.
* Many different American courts can rule on issues of constitutional law but the Supreme Court has the final say.
* Some amendments are particularly significant for American criminal justice: 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 14th (pp. 46-51).
* 4th Amendment: probibition against unreasonable searches and seizures (p. 46).
* 5th Amendment: grand jury indictments, double jeopardy, privilege against self-incrimination, and due process clause (p. 47).

### Lesson 18 - Saturday 9/19/20
